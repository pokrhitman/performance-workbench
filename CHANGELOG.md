All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## Session 1 - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Formula engine (`assets/js/perf-calculations.js`): simple return,
  annualize, linkReturns, time-weighted return, Modified Dietz, BVI
  return, and IRR/MWR (Newton-Raphson), plus shared validation and
  date helpers. Fully covered by a hand-written test harness
  (`tests.html`).
- Root landing page (`index.html`): hero section with a static
  verification-table preview, "Who is this for?" and "Explore by
  tier" sections.
- CSS token system (`assets/css/main.css`) and component styles
  (`assets/css/components.css`), including the site's color palette
  and fixed header/sidebar layout.
- Sidebar navigation (`assets/js/nav.js`), rendering the full planned
  site tree from a single `SIDEBAR_DATA` structure.
